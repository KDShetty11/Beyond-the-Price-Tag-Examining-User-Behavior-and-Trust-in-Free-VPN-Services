# Beyond the Price Tag: Examining User Behavior and Trust in Free VPN Services

> *"Everything you do through an untrustworthy free VPN should be expected to be monitored, tracked, and sold."* - Study Participant

## üìä Research Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive study investigating user trust in free Virtual Private Network (VPN) services through a dual-survey methodology. By comparing perspectives of general users and security-aware users, the research reveals a pronounced **privacy paradox**: users often adopt free VPNs despite low trust and limited understanding of data practices.

### üîç Key Research Questions

- To what extent do users understand and trust free VPN providers' data handling practices?
- What motivates users to choose free VPNs over paid alternatives?
- What issues do users commonly experience with free VPN services?
- What are users' perceptions of risks associated with free VPNs?


## üìë Main Findings

### The Privacy Paradox in Action

Our research uncovered a significant disconnect between user behavior and privacy concerns:

- **General users** (41.5% use free VPNs) are primarily motivated by **cost (73.5%)** despite showing **low trust** (30.9% minimal trust)
- **Security-aware users** strongly prefer **paid VPNs** (43.8%) and demonstrate deeper skepticism about free services
- Most users have **limited understanding** of data practices (48.9% unsure of how providers handle their data)


### Trust Levels Among User Groups

| Trust Level | General Users | Security-Aware Users |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Minimal Trust | 30.9% | 37.5% |
| Neutral | 37.2% | 25% |
| Moderate Trust | 16% | 0% |
| Complete Trust | 1.1% | 0% |

### Common Issues Reported

- **Performance Issues**: Slow speeds (51.2%), disconnections (40.7%)
- **Privacy Concerns**: Invasive ads (23.3%), data collection (9.3%)
- **Security Risks**: Malware exposure (7%), weak encryption (3.2%)

Security-aware users specifically highlighted concerns with:

- Data logging (93.8%)
- Weak encryption protocols (68.8%)
- Malware risks (62.5%)


## üî¨ Methodology

The study employed a dual-survey approach:

1. **General User Survey**: 94 participants with diverse demographic backgrounds
    - Conducted in April 2025
    - 22 questions covering demographics, usage patterns, trust, motivations, and risks
2. **Security-Aware User Survey**: 16 participants with cybersecurity expertise
    - Conducted April 11-19, 2025
    - Focused on technical evaluations and security concerns

## üí° Key Takeaways

- **Education Gap**: There's a significant need for user education about VPN data practices
- **Transparency Matters**: Both user groups prioritize transparency (37.2% general users, 100% security-aware users rate it highly)
- **Risk Awareness**: Security-aware users are reluctant to recommend free VPNs due to data logging and weak encryption concerns
- **Usage Patterns**: Free VPNs are primarily used for entertainment (52.6% anonymous browsing, 34.6% streaming) rather than sensitive tasks
